# Hacker Nerds
A Terminal-based game to learn UNIX-style file paths

![Terminal](tutorial-assets/images/terminal-small.png "macos terminal")

## Open the Terminal
On the iMac, go to /Applications/Utilities/ and double-click the Terminal application. This opens a "console window", which is how computers were used before Apple launched the Macintosh - with a "Graphic User Interface", aka a Desktop, mouse and icons - back in 1984.

Because the Internet was invented before the Mac, a lot of ways about how the Web works is based on old school computing. 

## Basic CLI Commands
- pwd: **Preset Working Directory**. Displays the path to your current directory (aka "folder") location.
- cd: **Change Directory**. (Go from one folder to another)
- cp: **Copy**. Copies a file from location A to location B
- mv: **Move**. Moves a file from location A to location B (or renames it in the same location)
- pico: A very simple command-line text editor (like a very simple Microsoft Word)
    - Move the cursor with the arrow keys.
    - control-o: Saves the changes made in pico.
    - control-x: Quits pico.
- rm: **Remove**. Deletes a file.
- mkdir: **Make Directory**. Creates an empty folder.
- rmdir: **Remove Directory**. Deletes an *empty* folder.
